Open main1.py. Before running it, what do you expect this program to do? 

# I expect it will check for the version of python is at least 3.7. Then, it will print "Greeting" and ask me for my favorite color.

Now right click on the window and select “Run Python File in Terminal”. Click in the bottom panel, and answer the question. Describe what happened. 

What do you think the program did with what you typed?

# The program do nothing with what I typed.


Open main2.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main1.py. 

What do you think the color = input() will do? 

# I think it will store what I input into the variable 'color'.

Run the program in the terminal and answer the question. Did the program do what you expected?

# Yes, it stored what I typed and print it out.


Open main3.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main2.py. 

What is happening on lines 11–14? 

# There is a if statement, if my input is 'Red' it will print 'Correct!'. If my input is not 'Red', it will print 'Sorry, try again.'

Why are lines 12 and 14 indented? 

# It is because they are in in the if statement and else statement.

Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you don’t capitalize Red? 

# It will print 'Sorry, try again.'

What does this tell you about "color"?

# This tell me python is a case sensitive lanaguage.


Open main4.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main2.py. 

# The different of this and main2.py is this program have 'or color == 'red' in line 11.

What problem is this trying to solve? 

# This program is trying to solve the case sensitive problem.

Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you use some other capitalization scheme (i.e., “RED” or “reD“)?

# All the other capitalization scheme is not correct.


Open main5.py. What do you expect line 11 to do? 

# I expect line 11 is trying to convert my input to lower case.

What problem is it trying to solve?

# It is trying to solve the case sensitive problem.

Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you add spaces before or after the word (i.e., “  RED  “ or “ red”)?

# If we add any space at any spot, it will not print 'Correct!'.


Open main6.py. How is line 11 different than main5.py? 

# This is a .strip() method in line 11.

What would you guess .strip() is doing? 

# I guess it will clear all the spaces before or after the word.

Run the program and answer the question. Is there another way of writing “red” that will break this logic?

# Yes, "r ed" will break the logic.


Open main7.py. Before running this program, how do you expect this to be different than main6.py? 

# This program will not solve for case sensitive problem but it prints another statement for pink color.

What is the purpose of line 11? 

# It changes its own value to lower case and clear the spaces before and after words.

Run the program and answer the question.



Open main8.py. What is the purpose of line 11? 

# The purpose of line 11 is to loop the whole indented part if the color not equal to 'red'.

Why are lines 12–19 indented? 

# It is because they are inside the while loop.

Run the program. What would happen if line 12 were moved before line 11 (and no longer indented)? 

# It will create an infinity loop.

Make that change and run the program again. To end any Python program, you can type ctrl-c.



Open main9.py. What is happening on line 12? 

# It is a while loop, loop the content if color is not equal to 'red'.

What is the purpose of “count”? 

# The purpose of "count" is to store how many time the loop have been execute.

What is happening on line 22? 

# It print out the number of time of the while loop get execute by using format. 

Run the program.
